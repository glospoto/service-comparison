# Services Comparison Framework
This project aims to develop a framework being able to compare different alternatives of different network services; the
underlying network can be setted up using different approaches, such as simulators or virtual machines, keeping the
scalability sustainable.
Consider that this framework is currently under develop, so it could be not stable!
